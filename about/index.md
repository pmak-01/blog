**Hi, I'm Pratham Makwana.**
<br><br>

I am a 16-year old attending the IB Diploma Programme at Ressun Lukio IB World School. I am interested in science and technology and aspire to be a roboticist. I love solving competitive programming and math problems, as well as making electronics projects with my Arduino kit. In my free time, I like to read books and play the keyboard.
